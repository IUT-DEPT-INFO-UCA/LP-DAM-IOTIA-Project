## Projet 2020-21 : Des questionnaires pour le suivi des patients.


### Contexte du projet

#### Accompagner la transformation numérique
The digital transformation of healthcare among others is driven by the aging/growing population challenge, the rise of chronic diseases, increasing costs and the changed expectations and behavior of people whereby digital health plays an increasingly important role.
Overall smart healthcare market value by 2020 is estimated to be $169.32 billion by 2020. A major part of it will be for remote patient monitoring.

#### Le projet CHAMPLAIN


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/IUT-DEPT-INFO-UCA/LP-DAM-IOTIA-Project/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/IUT-DEPT-INFO-UCA/LP-DAM-IOTIA-Project/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
